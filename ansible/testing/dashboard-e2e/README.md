# Dashboard E2E Test Pipeline

Ansible playbook that orchestrates the full Rancher Dashboard Cypress end-to-end
test pipeline. It provisions AWS infrastructure, deploys Rancher on K3s, runs
Cypress tests inside a Docker container, and tears everything down afterward.

## What It Does

```text
1. Provision    AWS EC2 instances via OpenTofu (rancher HA cluster, import cluster, custom node)
2. Deploy       K3s on each cluster, then Rancher via Helm on the HA cluster
3. Setup        Clone dashboard repo, configure Rancher (users, roles), build Docker image
4. Test         Run Cypress specs inside Docker against the live Rancher instance
5. Cleanup      Destroy all AWS resources (EC2, Route53 records, security groups)
```

Each phase is controlled by Ansible tags so you can run them independently.

## Prerequisites

The following must be available on the machine running the playbook:

| Tool | Ubuntu/Debian | macOS | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|-------|
| Ansible >= 2.16 | `uv tool install "ansible-core<2.17" --with ansible` | `brew install uv && uv tool install "ansible-core<2.17" --with ansible` | [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) first, or use `pip` |
| OpenTofu >= 1.11 | [opentofu.org/docs/intro/install](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install/) | `brew install opentofu` | Only needed for provisioning (`--tags provision`) |
| Docker or Podman | `sudo apt-get install docker.io` | [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) | For building and running the Cypress test image |
| Helm 3 | [helm.sh/docs/intro/install](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) | `brew install helm` | Used for version resolution in provision and setup |
| curl, git, xxd | `sudo apt-get install curl git xxd` | curl, git, xxd are built-in | `xxd` is used for random prefix generation |

Required Ansible collections (installed automatically by `init.sh` in Jenkins):

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install \
  cloud.terraform kubernetes.core "community.docker:<5" "community.crypto:<3" --upgrade
```

## Quick Start

```bash
cd ansible/testing/dashboard-e2e

# 1. Copy and edit variables
cp vars.yaml.example vars.yaml
# Edit vars.yaml  --  at minimum you need to set the AWS variables

# 2. Export credentials (secrets - don't put these in vars.yaml)
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..."
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..."

# Optional: for AKS/GKE cluster tests
export AZURE_AKS_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="..."
export AZURE_CLIENT_ID="..."
export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="..."
export GKE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT="..."

# 3. Run the full pipeline
ansible-playbook dashboard-e2e-playbook.yml

# Or use the containerized wrapper (Docker/Podman only prerequisite):
./run.sh
```

## Usage Examples

### Containerized wrapper (run.sh)

The `run.sh` wrapper runs everything inside a container. The only prerequisite
is Docker or Podman. Commands are simple verbs that can be combined:

```bash
# Full pipeline (provision → setup → test → cleanup)
./run.sh

# Provision + setup + test with live Cypress output
./run.sh stream provision

# Setup + test (most common, iterate on provisioned infra)
./run.sh stream

# Re-run tests only (after changing cypress_tags)
./run.sh stream test

# Provision + setup (no test)
./run.sh provision setup

# Setup + test (buffered output)
./run.sh setup test

# Destroy infrastructure
./run.sh destroy

# Rebuild the runner image
./run.sh build

# Use a local dashboard checkout (skip clone)
./run.sh stream --dashboard-dir ~/repos/dashboard

# Run a single spec file (path relative to dashboard dir)
./run.sh stream --dashboard-dir ~/repos/dashboard --spec cypress/e2e/tests/pages/generic/login.spec.ts

# Pass extra ansible flags
./run.sh test -v          # verbose
./run.sh test --check     # dry-run
```

### Direct Ansible (without container)

Use these when running Ansible directly on the host:

```bash
# Full pipeline
ansible-playbook dashboard-e2e-playbook.yml --tags provision,setup,test

# Provision only (long-lived environment)
ansible-playbook dashboard-e2e-playbook.yml --tags provision

# Setup + test (against provisioned infra)
ansible-playbook dashboard-e2e-playbook.yml --tags setup,test

# Re-run tests only
ansible-playbook dashboard-e2e-playbook.yml --tags test

# Cleanup
ansible-playbook dashboard-e2e-playbook.yml --tags cleanup,never
```

### Iterate on provisioned infrastructure

After a full provision run, you can re-run setup and tests
against the same infrastructure without reprovisioning:

```bash
# Provision + first test run (live Cypress output)
./run.sh stream provision

# Change tags, branch, or other settings in vars.yaml, then:
./run.sh stream

# Or just re-run tests with the existing Docker image:
./run.sh stream test

# When done, tear down:
./run.sh destroy
```

Or with direct Ansible:

```bash
ansible-playbook dashboard-e2e-playbook.yml --tags setup,test
ansible-playbook dashboard-e2e-playbook.yml --tags test
ansible-playbook dashboard-e2e-playbook.yml --tags cleanup,never
```

### Real-time Docker streaming

The `stream` command in `run.sh` handles this automatically. For direct Ansible
usage, run setup only, then Docker manually:

```bash
# Setup: clone dashboard, build image, generate .env
ansible-playbook dashboard-e2e-playbook.yml --tags setup

# Run Cypress with real-time streaming (default cloned checkout)
docker run --rm -t \
  --shm-size=2g \
  --env-file .env \
  -e NODE_PATH="" \
  -v "$PWD/dashboard:/e2e" \
  -w /e2e \
  dashboard-test:latest

# Or run Cypress with your local checkout (unprivileged user):
docker run --rm -it \
  --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  --shm-size=2g \
  --env-file .env \
  -e HOME=/tmp \
  -e KUBECONFIG=/root/.kube/config \
  -v /path/to/your/dashboard:/e2e \
  -w /e2e \
  dashboard-test:latest
```

### Test only (against existing Rancher)

Skip provisioning and run tests against an already-deployed Rancher instance.
You must set `rancher_host` to your Rancher URL and `job_type` to `existing`.

```bash
# With run.sh
./run.sh stream

# Or with direct Ansible
ansible-playbook dashboard-e2e-playbook.yml \
  --extra-vars "job_type=existing rancher_host=rancher.example.com" \
  --tags setup,test
```

### Cleanup only (destroy infrastructure)

Tear down all AWS resources (EC2, Route53) created during provisioning.

```bash
# With run.sh
./run.sh destroy

# Or with direct Ansible (requires both tags; 'never' prevents accidental execution)
ansible-playbook dashboard-e2e-playbook.yml --tags cleanup,never
```

### Jenkins integration

The [`cypress/jenkins/init.sh`](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/blob/master/cypress/jenkins/init.sh)
script in the [rancher/dashboard](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard) repository
wraps this playbook. It handles prerequisite installation, variable generation
from Jenkins environment variables, and real-time Cypress streaming.

```bash
# Full run (called by Jenkinsfile)
cypress/jenkins/init.sh

# Destroy only (called by Jenkinsfile finally block)
cypress/jenkins/init.sh destroy
```

Jenkins uses `--skip-tags test` so that Cypress output streams directly to
the Jenkins console with color support via init.sh's Docker run.

## Configuration

Variables are loaded from `vars.yaml` (copy from `vars.yaml.example`). When
running from Jenkins, `init.sh` generates this file automatically from
environment variables.

### AWS infrastructure

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `aws_region` | `us-west-1` | AWS region for all resources |
| `aws_instance_type` | `t3a.xlarge` | EC2 instance type |
| `aws_volume_size` | `60` | Root volume size in GB |
| `server_count` | `3` | Number of Rancher HA nodes (1 or 3) |

The following are **required** and have no defaults. Export them as environment
variables. Do not put secrets in `vars.yaml`:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|--------|
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | AWS credentials |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | AWS credentials |
| `AZURE_AKS_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | Azure subscription (for AKS cluster tests) |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | Azure service principal (for AKS cluster tests) |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Azure service principal secret (for AKS cluster tests) |
| `GKE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` | GCP service account JSON (for GKE cluster tests) |

The remaining AWS settings go in `vars.yaml`:
`aws_ami`, `aws_route53_zone`, `aws_vpc`, `aws_subnet`, `aws_security_group`

### Rancher

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `rancher_helm_repo` | `rancher-com-rc` | Helm repo name (see "Helm Repos and Image Resolution" below) |
| `rancher_image_tag` | `v2.14-head` | Rancher image tag. Controls target branch: `v2.14-head` -> `release-2.14`, `head` -> `master` |
| `k3s_kubernetes_version` | `v1.30.0+k3s1` | K3s version for all clusters |
| `bootstrap_password` | `password` | Rancher first-boot password |
| `rancher_password` | `password1234` | Permanent admin password set after bootstrap |
| `ui_offline_preferred` | unset | Pin the UI to the one the image embeds. See "Which UI the tests run against" below |

### Which UI the tests run against

Rancher does not necessarily serve the UI that ships inside its image. The
`ui-offline-preferred` setting decides, and its default is `dynamic`:

| Image | `dynamic` serves | The image itself embeds |
|-------|------------------|-------------------------|
| `v2.15.0` | the UI in the image | `v2.15.0` |
| `v2.15-head` | `releases.rancher.com/dashboard/release-2.15/`, rebuilt from the branch | `v2.15.0`, the last GA build |
| `head` (master) | `releases.rancher.com/dashboard/master/` | `master` |

The default is usually what a release branch run wants. A `-head` image embeds
the last GA UI, not the branch's, so pinning the UI to the image would test a
current backend against weeks old UI and would not exercise any UI change made
on the branch. Only `head` off master embeds a UI matching its own branch.

The cost of the default is that the branch path is rebuilt continuously, so two
runs of the same tag minutes apart can serve different UI builds. Rather than
change what is tested, the playbook records what was tested: the Rancher build,
the image digest and where the UI came from are printed after deployment, so a
result can be tied to a build afterwards.

Set `ui_offline_preferred: "true"` to pin the UI to the image anyway, when a
run needs to be repeatable and testing the branch's UI is not the point, for
example when validating a change to the tests themselves. The playbook then
asserts the setting took effect.

Note that pinning can mask a UI regression: in one run a broken branch UI failed
nine of ten tests, while the same backend with the image's own UI failed only
the one test caused by the backend.

### Helm Repos and Image Resolution

Rancher is released through two pipelines: **Prime** (SUSE registry) and
**Community** (Docker Hub). Each pipeline has production, RC, and alpha stages.

Each repo is self-contained: chart and image are resolved from the same source.
For Prime staging repos (`rancher-latest`, `rancher-alpha`), the resolved chart
version becomes the image tag (e.g. `2.14.0-alpha13` → `v2.14.0-alpha13`).

| `rancher_helm_repo` | Chart source | Image registry | Image tag |
|---------------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| `rancher-prime` | charts.rancher.com/.../prime | `registry.suse.com` | `v{chart_version}` |
| `rancher-latest` | charts.optimus.rancher.io/.../latest | `stgregistry.suse.com` | `v{highest -rc match}`, or the head chart's `appVersion` |
| `rancher-alpha` | charts.optimus.rancher.io/.../alpha | `stgregistry.suse.com` | `v{highest -alpha match}` |
| `rancher-community` | releases.rancher.com/.../stable | Docker Hub | `rancher_image_tag` as-is |
| `rancher-com-rc` | releases.rancher.com/.../latest | Docker Hub | `rancher_image_tag` as-is |
| `rancher-com-alpha` | releases.rancher.com/.../alpha | Docker Hub | `rancher_image_tag` as-is |

An exact match always wins: if `rancher_image_tag` names a chart version that
exists in the repo (`v2.13.4` → `2.13.4`), that chart is used and no ranking is
done. Ranking only decides what a partial tag such as `v2.13` means.

### Prime head builds

Since August 2026 the Release Team publishes Prime head builds, one per
scheduled build of each release branch, into the **same** `rancher-latest`
repo that holds the RCs. Two things follow, and both are handled here:

- Chart versions carry the patch and the commit: `2.16.0-<sha>-head`. Ordering
  them with `sort -V` sorts by the SHA, which is meaningless, so head charts
  are picked by the `created` date in the repo's `index.yaml` instead.
- Release lines that only get Prime head builds (2.15 and 2.16 at the time of
  writing) have no `-rc` chart at all. A bare `v2.15` used to resolve to
  nothing and fail the run.

`rancher-latest` therefore resolves in this order:

| `rancher_image_tag` | resolves to |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `v2.14` | highest `2.14.x-rc`; if the line has none, the newest `2.14.x-<sha>-head` |
| `v2.16` | no RCs exist for the line → newest `2.16.x-<sha>-head` |
| `v2.16-head` | newest `2.16.x-<sha>-head`, RCs ignored |
| `head` | newest head chart of the highest line in the repo (master) |

RCs keep priority, so existing `v2.14`/`v2.13` jobs are unaffected. The image
tag for a head build comes from the chart's `appVersion`
(`v2.16.0-<sha>-head`), which pins the run to the exact build that was tested.
Note that `rancher_image_tag` still decides the dashboard branch, so `v2.16`
and `v2.16-head` both check out `release-2.16`.

Community repos are unchanged: their head charts still live in the per-line
`charts.optimus.rancher.io/server-charts/release-{major}.{minor}` repos, which
this playbook does not use, and `rancher-com-rc` with `v2.14-head` still
resolves an RC chart with the Docker Hub floating tag.

### Examples

```yaml
# Prime stable - released 2.13.4
rancher_helm_repo: "rancher-prime"
rancher_image_tag: "v2.13.4"
# → chart 2.13.4 from rancher-prime, image registry.suse.com/rancher/rancher:v2.13.4

# Prime RC - test the latest 2.13 release candidate
rancher_helm_repo: "rancher-latest"
rancher_image_tag: "v2.13"
# → highest 2.13.x-rc from optimus/latest, image stgregistry.suse.com/rancher/rancher:v2.13.8-rc1

# Prime head - newest scheduled build of release-2.16
rancher_helm_repo: "rancher-latest"
rancher_image_tag: "v2.16"        # or "v2.16-head" to skip RCs on a line that has them
# → newest 2.16.0-<sha>-head from optimus/latest by creation date,
#   image stgregistry.suse.com/rancher/rancher:v2.16.0-<sha>-head

# Prime alpha - test the next minor
rancher_helm_repo: "rancher-alpha"
rancher_image_tag: "v2.14"
# → highest 2.14.x-alpha from optimus/alpha, image stgregistry.suse.com/rancher/rancher:v2.14.5-alpha1

# Community GA - stable community release
rancher_helm_repo: "rancher-community"
rancher_image_tag: "v2.13.3"
# → chart 2.13.3 from releases.rancher.com/stable, image rancher/rancher:v2.13.3

# Community RC (default) - test upcoming community release
rancher_helm_repo: "rancher-com-rc"
rancher_image_tag: "v2.14-head"
# → latest 2.14.x chart from releases.rancher.com/latest, image rancher/rancher:v2.14-head

# Community alpha
rancher_helm_repo: "rancher-com-alpha"
rancher_image_tag: "v2.14.0-alpha9"
# → chart 2.14.0-alpha9 from releases.rancher.com/alpha, image rancher/rancher:v2.14.0-alpha9

# Dev head - latest from any repo
rancher_helm_repo: "rancher-com-rc"
rancher_image_tag: "head"
# → latest chart in the repo, image rancher/rancher:head
```

### The branch contract

Everything version related is decided by one file in the dashboard checkout,
`cypress/package.json`. It is to this playbook what `cluster_nodes_json` is to
the Tofu to Ansible boundary: the single place a branch declares what it needs.

| the playbook reads | and decides |
|--------------------|-------------|
| the file exists | whether the dependency overlay runs at all |
| its `cypress` pin | `cypress_version`, so the baked binary and the installed package agree |
| its `@cypress/grep` pin | whether the legacy `src/support` import is rewritten, and whether grep settings go through `expose` or `env` |
| which of `_runtime_deps` it declares | what `cypress.sh` installs at container start |

Two consequences follow. A branch that carries the file is self consistent and
is left alone, which is every branch from `release-2.14` onwards. A branch that
does not carry it has no contract to read, so one is borrowed from another
branch, which is what the overlay does and why `release-2.13` needs it.

Nothing else is inspected. Not the branch name, not `rancher_image_tag`, not
anything you pass in `vars.yaml`. Editing this file by hand changes what the
whole pipeline does.

### Cypress test runner

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `cypress_tags` | `@adminUser` | Cypress grep tags to run (e.g. `@userMenu`, `@adminUser+@components`) |
| `allow_filtered_catalog_skip` | `true` | When `true`, chart tests may skip if the chart is filtered out of the UI catalog. Set to `false` to fail instead. |
| `job_type` | `recurring` | `recurring` provisions new infra; `existing` skips provisioning |
| `create_initial_clusters` | `true` | Whether to create import cluster and custom node. In `existing` mode, provisions only these resources (not the Rancher server) |
| `dashboard_repo` | `rancher/dashboard` | Dashboard GitHub repo to clone |
| `dashboard_branch` | (auto-detected) | Branch to clone. Auto-detected from `rancher_image_tag` (e.g. `v2.14-head` → `release-2.14`) |
| `dashboard_overlay_branch` | (resolved) | Branch to overlay dependency files from (package.json, yarn.lock, cypress.config.ts), for branches that carry no `cypress/package.json` of their own. Left unset, the nearest newer release branch pinning the same Cypress major is used, falling back to `master`. CI files always come from the playbook's `files/` directory |

### Using a local dashboard checkout

The `--dashboard-dir` flag lets you point at your own local `rancher/dashboard`
checkout instead of cloning from GitHub. The playbook skips the clone, overlay,
and delete steps. Your working tree is mounted directly into the containers.

```bash
# Setup + test with live output, using your local repo
./run.sh stream --dashboard-dir ~/repos/dashboard

# Re-run tests (reuses the image, your local edits are picked up)
./run.sh stream test --dashboard-dir ~/repos/dashboard
```

This is useful when:
- You want to test **uncommitted changes** without pushing to a remote
- You want to avoid the clone/overlay cycle during iteration
- You have a large dashboard checkout and don't want to duplicate it

> **Important:** When using `--dashboard-dir`, `dashboard_repo` and `dashboard_branch`
> (for example `dashboard_repo: "izaac/dashboard"` or `dashboard_branch: "issue-2459"`)
> are **ignored** because the local checkout is used instead of cloning. Developers and QA
> are responsible for ensuring that their local code branch is compatible with the targeted
> `rancher_helm_repo` and `rancher_image_tag`, otherwise tests may fail with unexpected UI errors.

> **Branch requirement:** `--dashboard-dir` requires a `release-2.14` or newer
> checkout. The checkout has to carry its test dependencies in
> `cypress/package.json` and `cypress/yarn.lock`, and those manifests have to
> declare the packages the run loads: `cypress`, `@cypress/grep`, the two
> reporters, `junit-report-merger`, `find-test-names` and `globby`.
> `release-2.13` and older keep the test dependencies in the root
> `package.json` altogether.
>
> Everything the run loads is installed from `cypress/yarn.lock` and nothing is
> added at run time, so a gap cannot be filled in later. `run.sh` rejects such a
> directory up front, before any infrastructure is provisioned. To test an older
> branch, drop `--dashboard-dir` and set `dashboard_branch`; the clone path
> overlays the manifests from `dashboard_overlay_branch`.

> **Cypress version:** the checkout supplies its own [branch
> contract](#the-branch-contract), so `cypress_version` is read from its
> `cypress/package.json` and any value you pass is overridden. Nothing is
> overlaid onto a local checkout, which means the manifests and the specs are
> whatever your branch has. If you branch off `release-2.15` you get Cypress 11
> and your specs must be written for it; if you branch off `master` you get
> Cypress 15. Mixing the two breaks in ways the playbook cannot detect, for
> example `cy.exec` yields `code` up to Cypress 14 and `exitCode` from Cypress
> 15. Keeping your branch rebased on its upstream avoids this.

> **Note:** The setup stage writes into your checkout to build the test image:
> CI files in `cypress/jenkins/` (`Dockerfile.ci`, `cypress.sh`, and others),
> plus `results.xml` and `cypress/jenkins/reports/` from the run. Some of those
> CI files are tracked in dashboard and the rest are not covered by its
> `.gitignore`, so restore them before committing:
>
> ```bash
> git checkout -- cypress/jenkins/
> git clean -fd cypress/jenkins/ && rm -f results.xml
> ```
>
> Nothing else in your checkout is modified. The imported cluster kubeconfig is
> written to this playbook's `outputs/` rather than into your tree, and the
> `node_modules` link the run creates at the checkout root is removed when the
> run finishes. Test dependencies are installed from `cypress/yarn.lock` into
> `cypress/node_modules`, with the cloud credentials and reporting tokens
> removed from the install's environment. No manifest in your tree is written
> to.
>
> `./run.sh clean` does not touch the files listed above. It removes the
> wrapper's own artifacts in this directory, the cloned checkout, `outputs/`
> and `.env`.
>
> A `node_modules` directory you installed yourself at the checkout root is left
> alone. Test dependencies are installed into and read from `cypress/node_modules`
> either way, so the two never mix.

### Running a single spec file

The `--spec` flag lets you run a single Cypress spec instead of the full suite.
The path is **relative to the dashboard directory** (either `--dashboard-dir` or
the cloned checkout).

```bash
# Run a single spec with live output
./run.sh stream --dashboard-dir ~/repos/dashboard \
  --spec cypress/e2e/tests/pages/generic/login.spec.ts

# Re-run just the test stage with a different spec
./run.sh stream test --dashboard-dir ~/repos/dashboard \
  --spec cypress/e2e/tests/pages/explorer/workloads/pods.spec.ts
```

`--spec` requires the `stream` command, because the buffered ansible test stage runs
the container without extra arguments, so `run.sh` refuses the flag without
`stream` instead of silently running the full suite. It is independent of
`--dashboard-dir`, so you can use either or both.

Validation: when the dashboard directory already exists locally the spec path
is checked before any containers start; on a first run (no clone yet) the check
happens inside the container instead. Globs and comma-separated lists are
passed through to Cypress unvalidated.

Tag interaction: `--spec` replaces the tag-based **spec pre-filter**
(`grep-filter.ts`), but `CYPRESS_grepTags` still filters tests at **runtime**.
With a positive tag such as `@adminUser`, only matching tests inside your spec
run. To run everything in the spec, leave `cypress_tags` empty: tag adjustment
then produces exclusion-only tags (`-@prime+-@noVai`), which match every test
that is not prime/noVai. `@bypass` drops those exclusions too.

`--spec` selects which file runs and nothing else. The Cypress version comes
from the checkout, so it is the same whether you run one spec or all of them.

### Testing release branches (release-2.14, release-2.15, ...)

Execution specs come from the target branch (auto-detected from
`rancher_image_tag`, or set via `dashboard_branch`), and CI files come from this
playbook's `files/` directory.

Dependencies follow the branch rather than master. A checkout that carries its
own [branch contract](#the-branch-contract) is self consistent, so it keeps its
own dependency manifests and its own Cypress. That layout exists from
`release-2.14` onwards. Older branches have no contract to read, so
`package.json`, `yarn.lock`, `cypress/package.json`, `cypress/yarn.lock` and
`cypress.config.ts` are overlaid from another branch, chosen in this order:

1. `dashboard_overlay_branch`, when set. An explicit value always wins.
2. The nearest newer release branch, searched across the next three minors,
   whose `cypress/package.json` pins the same Cypress major as the target's root
   `package.json`. Nearest is closest in time to the target, so its spec set and
   dependency surface have drifted least.
3. `master`, which is what the playbook did before.

The contract is then read from whichever `cypress/package.json` the checkout
ends up with.

Cross-version compatibility is handled automatically:

- master pins `@cypress/grep` v6, whose `exports` map removed the
  `@cypress/grep/src/support` entrypoint that older branches import in
  `cypress/support/e2e.ts`. The setup stage rewrites that import to the
  v5+/v6 `register` API when the resolved `@cypress/grep` major is >= 5, so a
  branch keeping its own v3/v4 grep is left alone.
- `cypress.config.jenkins.ts` and `grep-filter.ts` (from `files/`) support
  both the v5+/v6 (`dist/`, exports map) and legacy v3/v4 (`src/`) layouts.
- Cypress 11 will not accept a suite level `testIsolation` without
  `experimentalSessionAndOrigin`, and Cypress 12 removed that option.
  `cypress.config.jenkins.ts` sets it only when `@cypress/grep/plugin` does not
  resolve, which is the same signal that says the checkout is on the old stack.

Caveats:

- The overlay search window is the next three minors. A branch further behind
  than that falls back to master, which is the previous behaviour.
- Specs are written against the Cypress version their branch pins. `cy.exec`
  yields `code` up to Cypress 14 and `exitCode` from Cypress 15, so running a
  branch under the wrong major breaks `cluster-manager.spec.ts` even when the
  suite loads.

### Pinned versions

These are kept in sync with the
[Cypress Docker factory](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images/blob/master/factory/.env).
Only change them if the factory updates.

| Tool | Default | Source |
|------|---------|--------|
| Chrome | `146.0.7680.164-1` | Factory `.env` |
| Node.js | `24.14.0` | Factory `.env` |
| Yarn | `1.22.22` | Factory `.env` |
| Cypress | `15.19.0` | Dashboard `package.json` |

## Cypress Tag System

The playbook automatically adjusts Cypress tags before running tests. This
mirrors the logic in the upstream dashboard `init.sh`:

- **Non-prime repos** (e.g. `rancher-com-rc`, `rancher-stable`): Appends
  `+-@prime` to exclude prime-only tests.
- **Prime repos** (`rancher-prime`, `rancher-latest`, `rancher-alpha`): Appends
  `+-@noPrime` to exclude non-prime tests.
- **Always**: Appends `+-@noVai` to exclude VAI-specific tests.
- **Bypass**: If `@bypass` is present in the tags, no automatic exclusions are
  added. Use this when you want full control over which tests run.

Example: Input `@userMenu` with repo `rancher-com-rc` becomes
`@userMenu+-@prime+-@noVai`.

## Tags

| Tag | What it runs |
|-----|-------------|
| `provision` | Infrastructure provisioning (OpenTofu) + K3s + Rancher deploy + Helm resolution |
| `setup` | Clone dashboard, copy CI files, build Docker image, generate .env |
| `test` | Cypress Docker run + result collection |
| `cleanup` | Infrastructure teardown (requires `--tags cleanup,never`) |

Pre-tasks (validation, tag adjustment) use `always` with conditional guards;
they are evaluated on every run but skip work that doesn't apply (e.g. Cypress
tag adjustment is skipped during `cleanup`, host validation is skipped when
`provision` will create it).

## Outputs

After a successful run, the following artifacts are available:

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `dashboard/results.xml` | JUnit XML test results |
| `dashboard/cypress/reports/html/` | Mochawesome HTML report with screenshots |
| `notification_values.txt` | Rancher version info for Slack notifications |
| `outputs/` | SSH keys, kubeconfigs, tfvars, per-workspace `<workspace>-nodes.json` (raw `cluster_nodes_json` from Tofu) and `inventory-<workspace>/inventory.yml` (generated by `scripts/generate_inventory.py`); cleaned up on destroy |

### Key Scripts and Tasks

- **`files/`** contains CI files that are an infrastructure concern, not test code.
  The playbook copies them into the dashboard clone during setup, making the
  playbook fully self-contained. No git overlay needed for CI files.
- **`rancher_user_setup` role** (`ansible/roles/rancher_user_setup/`) creates
  Rancher local users with global and project role bindings via the Rancher API.
  Parameterized: accepts a list of users, roles, and project bindings. Idempotent
  (skips if resources already exist). Error handling configurable (`fail` or `warn`).
- **`files/grep-filter.ts`** pre-filters Cypress spec files by tag before
  Cypress launches. Runs inside the Docker container to reduce unnecessary
  spec loading.

## Troubleshooting

### OpenTofu init fails with "Failed to install provider"

Transient GitHub rate limit. Re-run the pipeline -- it will retry automatically.

### K3s fails to start

Check the K3s version compatibility with your AMI. The default `v1.30.0+k3s1`
works with Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 AMIs. If using a newer AMI, you may need a newer
K3s version.

### Rancher setup returns 401 Unauthorized

The playbook changes the admin password from `bootstrap_password` to
`rancher_password` during deploy. Make sure `rancher_password` in vars.yaml
matches what you expect. The `rancher_user_setup` role uses `rancher_password`.

### Cypress tests fail with "baseUrl not reachable"

The Rancher UI may not be ready yet. The playbook waits up to 5 minutes for
`/dashboard/auth/login` to return 200. If your Rancher is slow to start,
increase the `retries` value in `setup-test-env.yml`.

### Cleanup fails with "workspace not found"

This is safe to ignore. The cleanup uses `|| exit 0` so missing workspaces
(e.g. if provisioning was skipped) do not cause failures.

### `xxd: command not found`

The playbook uses `xxd` to generate random resource prefixes. It ships with
macOS and most Linux distros. On minimal systems: `apt-get install xxd`.

### Shell compatibility

All shell tasks in the playbook are POSIX-compatible (`/bin/sh`). There is no
`/bin/bash` dependency; the playbook runs on any system with a POSIX shell.

## Dependencies

Ansible collections required (install manually or let `init.sh` handle it in Jenkins):

- `cloud.terraform` is required by the shared `ansible/k3s/default/k3s-playbook.yml` as a
  fallback when `kube_api_host`/`fqdn` are absent from the inventory. dashboard-e2e
  itself no longer relies on this path: `scripts/generate_inventory.py` bakes both
  values into `all.vars`, so the lookup is inert during normal runs.
- `kubernetes.core` for Kubernetes resource operations.
- `community.docker` **< 5** for Docker image build and container
  management (v5+ requires ansible-core ≥ 2.17).
- `community.crypto` **< 3** for SSH keypair generation
  (v3+ requires ansible-core ≥ 2.17).
